| **Script** | **Description** |
| -------- | -------- |
| _0-alias_ | The code alias ls="rm *" creates an alias that redefines the ls command to execute rm *, which forcefully deletes all files in the current directory when the ls command is used. Caution is advised when using this alias, as it can result in unintended data loss. |
| _1-hello_you_ | The code echo "hello $USER" is a simple shell command used to display a greeting message. It dynamically inserts the currently logged-in user's name, obtained from the $USER environment variable, into the message. When executed, it prints a personalized greeting such as "hello username" to the terminal. |
| _2-path_ | The code export PATH=$PATH:/action is used to extend the system's PATH environment variable by adding the directory "/action." This allows the shell to search for and execute programs located in the "/action" directory without specifying the full path, simplifying the execution of commands. |
| _3-paths_ | The code calculates and echoes the number of directories in the system's PATH environment variable. It does so by counting the occurrences of ":/" using grep and wc -l, then adding 1 to account for the initial directory. The result represents the number of directories in the PATH. |
| _4-global_variables_ | The code printenv is a command used to display a list of all environment variables currently set in the shell session. When executed, it prints the names and values of these variables, providing a snapshot of the environment configuration within the current shell session. |
| _5-local_variables_ | The code set is a shell command that displays a list of all variables, both local and environment variables, along with their values. It also shows the currently defined shell functions. Running set provides a comprehensive view of the current shell session's variables and functions. |
| _6-create_local_variable_ | The code BEST="School" sets a local variable named BEST with the value "School." This variable can be used within the script or shell session to store and reference the string "School" for various purposes, making it accessible for further operations or output within the script. |
| _7-create_global_variable_ | The code export BEST="School" sets a local variable named BEST with the value "School" and exports it as an environment variable. Exporting allows child processes to access the variable. This command makes the BEST variable available to other commands and programs executed within the shell session. |
| _8-true_knowledge_ | The code echo $(($TRUEKNOWLEDGE + 128)) performs arithmetic addition on a variable or numeric value represented by $TRUEKNOWLEDGE. It adds 128 to this value and echoes the result to the console. The expression within the $((...)) construct is evaluated, and the result is displayed as output. |
| _9-divide_and_rule_ | The code echo $(($POWER / $DIVIDE)) performs integer division on two variables, $POWER and $DIVIDE. It divides the value of $POWER by the value of $DIVIDE, and the result is displayed as output using the echo command. The expression within $((...)) is evaluated for the division operation. |
| _10-love_exponent_breath_ | The code echo $(($BREATH**$LOVE)) calculates the result of raising the value of the variable $BREATH to the power of the variable $LOVE. The expression within $((...)) is evaluated for exponentiation, and the result is displayed as output using the echo command. |
| _11-binary_to_decimal_ | The code echo $((2#$BINARY)) converts a binary number represented by the variable $BINARY into its decimal equivalent. The 2# prefix indicates that the value should be interpreted as a binary number, and the result is displayed as output using the echo command. |
| _12-combinations_ | The code generates all possible combinations of two lowercase alphabet characters (from 'aa' to 'zz') and uses the tr command to replace spaces with newline characters. It then uses grep with the -v flag to filter out combinations containing "oo." The result is a list of letter pairs excluding 'oo'. |
| _13-print_float_ | The code formats the value of the variable $NUM as a floating-point number with two decimal places using printf. It then pipes this formatted number to the sort command. However, since sort primarily sorts text lines, this code may not produce meaningful results unless $NUM represents a list of numbers separated by spaces. |
| _100-decimal_to_hexadecimal_ | The code uses printf to format the decimal value stored in the variable $DECIMAL as a hexadecimal number and then prints it. This conversion allows you to display the decimal value in its hexadecimal representation, which is often used in programming and low-level operations. |
| _101-rot13_ | The code performs a character mapping or substitution operation. It replaces each letter from 'a' to 'z' with the corresponding letter from 'n' to 'z' followed by 'a' to 'm'. Similarly, uppercase letters are mapped accordingly. This effectively shifts the alphabet by 13 positions, implementing a simple ROT13 cipher. |
| _102-odd_ | The Perl one-liner perl -lne 'print if $. % 2 == 1' processes input line by line and prints lines with odd line numbers (line numbers starting from 1). It filters and outputs every other line from the input data, effectively selecting and displaying lines with odd line numbers. |
| _103-water_and_stir_ | The code first converts the words in the variables $WATER and $STIR to numerical values in base-5 (using 'water'->'01234' and 'stir.'->'01234' transformations). It then adds these numerical values, converts the result to octal, and finally maps the octal digits to characters ('01234567'->'bestchol'). The output is a transformed string. |
